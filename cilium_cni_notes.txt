What is Cilium?

  Another K8S CNI provider

  Uses eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter)
    Using eBPF the need for kube-proxy is no longer necessary

  Networking
    CNI Provider

  Observability
    Hubble, provides distributed networking and security.

  Security
    L3/4, L7 and DNS based network polices

  Service Mesh (Beat)
    L7 traffic management & load balancing
    TLS termination
    etc..


  CALICO.. IPTABLES

  For K8S network providesr like Calico that uses IPTABLES there is a heavy overhead when
  the number of services is scaled up due to the use of IPTABLES and the large numbrer of
  rules required for a simple service.

  For each service added a multitude of iptables rules must be added.

  IPTABLES are not index, so sequential search is done to find which chains and rules
  appliled to each packet.

  Incremental changes are not supported (Copy all rules, make changes, then save back all rules)

  It was never designed to be an efficient load balancer in extremely demanding situations.


To enable eBPF on existing cluster or new cluster build (update ansible playbooks)

  # Create eBPF configmap
  kubectl create configmap --namespace=tigera-operator tigera-ebpf-operator --from-file=operators/tigera_ebpf_operator.yml

  # Patch tigera pod
  kubectl patch installation.operator.tigera.io default --type merge -p '{"spec":{"calicoNetwork":{"linuxDataplane":"BPF", "hostPorts":null}}}'

  # Patch kube-proxy (disable kube-proxy)
  kubectl patch ds -n kube-system kube-proxy -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"non-calico": "true"}}}}}'
